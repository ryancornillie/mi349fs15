		   <h3>Released November 6th</h3>
			<p>Spectre is the fourth Daniel Craig Bond movie and while being a fun action
			movie, Spectre ends up feeling hollow especially when compared to Skyall. Spectre provides
			plenty of fun, if not overly goofy, action set-pieces. Performances are solid as expected, and 
			the cinemotagraphy is stunning as Bond travels the globe in attempt to track down
			an international, undecover terror organiztion. Chrisoph Waltz's peformace as the film's 
			villian is fantastic, but the film fails to make him a stand out Bond villian. The plot is predicable and suffers from
			serious pacing issues, which is a major problem for a two and a half hour long movie.
			I caught myself checking the time in hopes that the ending was near. There is fun to be had here,
			but Spectre lacks the complexity and depth that made Skyall so wondeful. Spectre is an enjoyable, but shallow Bond film.
			</p>

	<div class="list review" onmouseover="showList(1); return false;" onmouseout="hideList(0); return false;">
	<h3>Released: October 2nd</h3>
	<p>The Martian is a Ridley Scott film based on the best-selling science fiction novel.
	Following my disapointment with Exodus: Gods and Kings, I was hoping that Scott would not
	let me down again; and he doesn't. Unlike Alien and Prometheus, The Martian scraps the dark,
	dreadful tone and instead is a testimanat to hope and human inginuity. After his presumed death, 
    Mark Watney is left stranded on Mars. The movie is focused on Mark's abililty to use his intelect to
	stay alive long enough to be rescured and humanity's combined effort to bring him home.  My only complaint
	is that the positive, hopeful tone comes at the cost of tension. But the drastically different tone
	is refresing. The movie is fun,emotional,inspirational, and encourages us to look to the stars.
	</p>
